This folder contains the R code used for the simulation study. 

The simulation study contains 14 steps. Every step has its own folder. In each folder,
a separate folder can be found for every simulation condition. In these subfolders,
all simulation output can be stored. The first step is to create all subfolders, this 
can be done using the r-code in 'create_folders.R'. Next, R-code should be run for step
1 to 14, which can be found in the separate folders, which all include a 'readme.txt' file
to guide you through it.
