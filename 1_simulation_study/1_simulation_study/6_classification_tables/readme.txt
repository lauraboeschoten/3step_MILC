The function 'create_folders.R' created folders for every condition in the simulation. 

You run the code in '6_TOP_classification.R', here the code from '6_fun_classification.R'  
is sourced. When you are finished, all folders contain 1000 files containing 5 classification
tables corresponding to the 5 imputed variables. These files are named 
'class_mat_<nr1-1000>.txt'.
